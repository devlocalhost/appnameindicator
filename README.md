# App Name Indicator
A GNOME Shell extension that shows the active app's name and icon on the left side of the top panel, like it used to, before version 49.0.

# Note
This extension does NOT restore the old, App Menu behavior. This extension simply adds the app's name and/or label, nothing else.

## Installation
- Get it from the GNOME Extensions website: [GNOME Extensions page].
- Or manually install it: TODO
